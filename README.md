## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Learned about nextElementSibling and prevElementSibling JS properties.
- How to use CSS Variables.
- The use of Transform-box and transform-origin in CSS to add animation to the SVG from it's center.
- How to make an infinite animation loop with that starts with a delay every time.
- How to add a background-image and a linear-gradient at the same time in CSS.
- How to position background-image outside of container.


### Continued development

I have to be consistent in my work and improve project time management. 

### Useful resources
